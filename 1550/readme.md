# CS1550 Operating Systems at the University of Pittsburgh
Modern computer software can run without specific knowledge of the underlying components of the physical machine. For instance, a program such as Microsoft Word can run on computers with varying amounts of RAM and can print a document without needing to know the make and model of the target printer. Physical resources such as memory and peripheral hardware are managed by the computerâ€™s Operating System software. This course examines the abstractions that an Operating System provides to user-level software, and how to most efficiently allocate resources between competing programs. Specifically, we will examine how to share and manage the CPU, memory, persistent storage, I/O devices, and communications.
