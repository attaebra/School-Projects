Part 1 - minimax_a_b.py

For the first file, test_tree1, the output is:

Utility value of root: 4
Number of nodes visited: 12

For the second file, test_tree2, the output is:

Utility value of root: 6
Number of nodes visited: 11

For the third file, test_tree3, the output is:

Utility value of root: 8
Number of nodes visited: 19

The way I implemented this based on the tree in the file, it didn't actually record where it was in the tree
at the time I was kind of confused how to make it work any other way. Instead of actually recording where it went
I opted to count the number of nodes visted.
